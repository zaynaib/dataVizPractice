### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ola and I enjoy looking at data visualizations like the ones that you see in [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) or [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/30/us/2019-year-in-graphics.html). 

The talk that truly inspired me to lookin into data visualization as a career was a Hans Rosling [Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) about world health.

ðŸŒ± I decided today to make practicing D3.js to be apart of my daily routine for 30 days. July 19,2020 - August 19,2020

In order to accomplish this goal I'll be reading through Amelia Wattenberger's book  [FullStack D3.js and DataVisualization](https://www.newline.co/fullstack-d3)
Check out the [log](./log.md) to see my progress.
