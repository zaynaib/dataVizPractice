## Day 0: July 18, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: I revamp my dataVizPractice repo for my 30 days of D3.js challenge.

## Day 1: July 19, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  Made my first d3 data visualization for this 30 day challenge. It was a line graph of weather day for the year of 2018. Finished half of chapter 1 of Amelia's book. 

**Emotion:**

**What I Learned Today**: 

[Async/Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await)

What does Async and await do 

Async/await makes your code look synchronous, and in a way it makes it behave more synchronously. The await keyword blocks execution of all the code that follows until the promise fulfills, exactly as it would with a synchronous operation.

**CORS Error**

CORS is short for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, a mechanism used to restrict
requests to another domain

[Accessor Functions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26330927/what-is-accessor-function)

Also known as mutator methods.

An accessor property is one that is defined in terms of getters and setters, not as a stored value that might be written to. The "pair of accessor functions" denotes the getter and the setter function.

*Key Concepts to D3.js*

Think of D3.js similar to The Grammar of Graphics.
Hadley Wickham wrote a great paper about this book. 
https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html

Essentially think of a graph like a photo in photoshop.
Photoshop uses layers in order to create a beautiful image.
Its a similar to D3.js. 

1. Access the Data
2. Set up your getters and setter functions /Accessors for your data
3. Set the dimensions of your chart(Check out Margin Conventions)
4. Draw the canvas - add SVG to HTML
5. set up your scales
6. Draw the graph
7. Draw the axis

**To Do**:
Practice creating a basic line chart from a basic dataset.

### Day 2: July 20, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Decided to apply what I learned on a data set that was not given from the book. I found a website that teaches basic math skills to childern 
https://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/graphs/line .

 Lets see how this goes.
